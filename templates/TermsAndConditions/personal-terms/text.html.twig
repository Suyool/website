    <p>
        1.1 SUYOOL SAL, a joint stock company duly incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Lebanon (“we”, “us”,

        providing electronic mobile wallet services and offers associated services, features, and functionalities
        (“Services”). This document outlines the terms and conditions governing your use and access to our website, our
        application (“App”) and any Services made available by us and our affiliates from time to time (collectively our
        “Platform”). As a user of our Platform, you may be referred to as “you”, “yours” or “User”. This document also
        sets out the terms and conditions for your SUYOOL personal account opened through our Platform (“Account”). It
        is essential for you to carefully review and understand these terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.2 These terms and conditions, along with the attached schedules, our Privacy Policy which explains how we
        collect, use and share information, and any other terms and conditions that apply to our Services, collectively
        constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us (the “Agreement”, or the “Terms”) and shall govern the
        use of your Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.3 By using our Platform, you explicitly acknowledge and confirm that you have read, understood, and

        deletion or amendment. If you expressly notify us that you do not agree with the proposed amendment(s) and that

    <div class="title">2. REGISTERING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</div>
    <p>
        2.1 Any request for registration will be subject to an e-KYC (electronic-Know Your Customer) procedure. We do
        this for a number of reasons, including to check your identity and to meet our legal and regulatory
        requirements. Our Privacy Policy explains more about how we use your information for these and other purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.2 Registration happens by downloading the App and following the steps presented on our Platform. To register,
        you must be over the age of 18 and provide us with all requested information and documentation, such as but not
        limited to your full name, email address, original identity card or passport, and personal identification number
        (“PIN”).
    </p>
    <p>
        2.3 We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to (i) amend and/or vary the registration prerequisites and/or
        the e-KYC and due diligence process according to the Applicable Laws and regulations, as amended from time to
        time and (ii) refuse to open or maintain your Account and to impose any restrictions on your Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.4 You agree that any registration information given to us is accurate, correct and up to date and to notify us
        immediately if there are any changes by updating your Account manually. At any point, we reserve the right to
        ask you to validate the accuracy of the provided information or to provide us with relevant documents or
        supporting evidence. To meet our legal and regulatory requirements, we may occasionally require additional
        information from you. Be sure to provide us with the requested information promptly so that there is no
        disruption in the provided Services or any transactions conducted. You will also solely be responsible and
        indemnify us against any and/or all claims and losses that occur due to the submission of false, inaccurate or
        incorrect information.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.5 Once you have available funds in your Account you will be able to use some of the Services offered through
        our Platform. You may store in your Account either Fresh USD or Fresh LBP.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.6 By using our Platform, you acknowledge and agree that your Account is not a bank account or deposit account
        nor does it offer the features and benefits of a traditional bank account or deposit account. There is no
        overdraft facility available on your Account and we do not pay interest to you.
    </p>

    <div class="title">3. USING YOUR AVAILABLE BALANCE AND YOUR ACCOUNT’S FUNCTIONALITIES AND FEATURES</div>
    <p>
        Your Account holds electronically stored monetary value issued by us on receipt of funds in either Fresh USD or
        Fresh LBP. You can use the Available Balance for various purposes, and can initiate transactions (each a
        “transaction”), subject to having sufficient funds, the eligibility of the recipient to receive funds, and the
        applicable fees, restrictions, and limits as set forth in the App. You acknowledge that you are responsible for
        all transactions carried out through your Account and give us permission to process your transaction
        instructions and receive funds on your behalf. Below you can find some examples that illustrate some of these
        transactions.
    </p>
    <p>3.1 Adding funds to your Account/Account top-up and receiving money into your Account</p>
    <p>
        (a) Upon activation of your Account, you can add funds to your Account or receive funds into your Account by any
        of the following methods:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Receiving your salary into your Account;<br>
        2. receiving transfers from other SUYOOL users, whether individuals or corporates, within our network of
        electronic wallets;<br>
        3. depositing cash into your Account either by visiting any Agent within our network of Agents or by other means
        as described in the App, while following the provided prompts and instructions through the App;<br>
        4. using a registered debit or credit card.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) The Available Balance displayed in your Account will serve as conclusive evidence of your remaining balance.
        You hereby acknowledge and agree that your Available Balance is not subject to receiving any interest or any
        other earnings whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2 Using your Available Balance and making transfers and payments
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) Banknote Withdrawals<br> You can withdraw money from your Account by following the instructions provided on
        the App and then by visiting any Agent within our network of Agents, or by other means as provided in the App,
        or by making an ATM withdrawal using your SUYOOL Card.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Transfers<br>
        - You can send and receive money to and from other SUYOOL accounts and these transfers are processed instantly.
        To transfer money to another SUYOOL account, you need to input the relevant recipient information and follow the
        provided prompts. Any newly added recipient will remain pending until validated by us.<br>
        - You can also send money to any bank account abroad falling within our coverage by selecting the bank transfer
        option in the Account tab and providing the required information, such as the account number and IBAN. If money
        transferred by you to another account is not paid into that account and is returned to us, and if we had to
        perform a currency exchange during the original transfer, we will convert the returned amount back to the
        original currency. We are not responsible for any losses incurred by you in this process.
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) Payments You will be able to make payments at Merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
        (d) Utilities & Services You will be able to pay utilities and services as available in the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.3 Using your SUYOOL Card
    </p>
    <p>
        You can request, activate, manage, and cancel your SUYOOL Card linked to your Account at any time. The issuance,
        usage, and security aspects of the SUYOOL Cards are governed by our card issuer terms, the terms and conditions
        of CSCBank SAL, and the relevant card association's rules and regulations (collectively referred to as the “Card
        Terms”). By requesting a SUYOOL Card, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the Card
        Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.4 Currency Exchange
    </p>
    <p>(a) You can instruct us to initiate a currency exchange of the Available Balance or any portion thereof from one
        currency to another. The available currencies for such exchanges are Fresh LBP and Fresh USD</p>
    <p>(b) The exchange rate is set by our partnered exchange house and is based on the real market rate adopted at the
        time of the conversion. You can always see the real-time exchange rate in the App, and the transaction history
        of your Account will indicate the exchange rate adopted to execute a transaction. </p>
    <p>(c) You assume all risks associated with currency conversion and agree that we are not responsible for any
        losses, including exchange rate fluctuations, fees, or other related charges incurred during the currency
        conversion process. It is recommended that you carefully consider the prevailing exchange rates and any
        associated costs before initiating any currency exchange or making payments in foreign currencies</p>
    <p>(d) While we recommend that payments to and from your Account are made in the preferred currency of your Account,
        you can activate the auto-exchange feature on your Account. This feature will automatically convert the required
        amount from the other currency in your Account to cover a purchase when your preferred currency balance is
        insufficient. This conversion will take place at the checkout of the Merchant at the prevailing market rate,
        including any applicable fees, at the time of such payment is executed. This means that your Account might be
        credited with more or less than you expected, and we won't be responsible for any losses if this happens.</p>
    <p>3.5 Limits and Fees</p>
    <p>(a) We may impose limitations and fees for each transaction, including on the receipt, payment, and withdrawal of
        funds into or from your Account, as well as the withdrawal or spending limits and fees for using your SUYOOL
        Card, at our reasonable discretion. We may also limit the value of currency exchange that you can perform within
        a given time period. You can see our limits and fees in the App and we can change these fees and limits at any
        time. You will be notified of such changes through our Platform and we will assume you are happy with the change
        unless you tell us you want to close your Account before the change takes effect. By accepting these Terms, you
        authorize us to debit your Account for any applicable fees.</p>
    <p>(b) You acknowledge that certain third parties, such as banks, may impose fees on inbound or outbound
        transactions. We hold no responsibility or liability for such fees, as they are determined and imposed solely by
        the respective third parties.</p>
    <p>3.6 Transaction Handling</p>
    <p>(a) Your transaction may be declined if you do not have sufficient funds in your Account to cover the transaction
        amount and the applicable fees. You cannot cancel or revoke a payment or transaction instruction that has
        already been received by us, nor can you withdraw your consent to execute a transaction.</p>
    <p>(b) Before you send money to someone or make a transfer, double-check that you have the correct recipient
        details. If you send money to the wrong person because of a mistake in the information, we cannot take
        responsibility for it. We'll try to help you get your money back with no guarantee of success.</p>
    <p>(c) Transactions between SUYOOL accounts are credited instantly. The processing time for other transactions will
        vary and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Please note that we will not be responsible for the funds
        until they are received by us. </p>
    <p>(d) We reserve the right to reverse a transaction if the payer, the payer's bank, or the payment service provider
        initiates a reversal or if there is a reasonable likelihood of such a reversal being initiated in relation to
        your Account. In the event of a reversal, we retain the right to deduct the reversed transaction amount from
        your Account balance. If your Account balance is insufficient to cover the reversal, we may request repayment
        from you.</p>
    <p>(e) When carrying out a transaction through any of our Agents, you may be required to provide proof of a valid
        identification document to the Agent or any other information to verify your identification to match your
        Account.</p>
    <div class="title">4. TRACKING YOUR ACCOUNT’S ACTIVITY</div>
    <p>
        4.1 You can track the activity and transactions associated with your Account, review their history, and download
        your Account statements through the App. You will have access to your Account activity information, including
        the downloadable statements, until your Account is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.2 We will send a notification to your Device to inform you of any incoming or outgoing payments, transactions,
        or transfers. The transactions will be displayed in your online transaction history on the App together with the
        date of receipt (the credit value date) and the fees charged (the “Transaction History”). Each transaction will
        be given a unique transaction ID and shown on the App. You should quote this transaction ID when communicating
        with us about a particular transaction. We do not and shall not be obliged to provide you with a physical or
        written confirmation in respect of any transaction. You should regularly check your Transaction History for
        comprehensive information on your transactions.
    </p>

    <div class="title">
        5. KEEPING YOUR ACCOUNT AND SUYOOL CARD SAFE
    </div>
    <p>
        5.1 You are responsible for ensuring the utmost security and integrity of your Account and your SUYOOL Card and
        take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorised or fraudulent use of them. This includes diligently
        safeguarding your security details associated with your Account and your SUYOOL Card and securing the Device
        used to access the Account. These security details encompass usernames, passwords, and PINs commonly referred to
        as “Credentials”.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.2 To ensure the highest level of security for your Account, it is essential that you implement or arrange for
        the following precautions:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) Conceal PINs in a manner that makes it difficult for others to decipher.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, telephone numbers, or predictable number
        sequences as PINs.
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) Prohibit the storage of security details on any Device.
    </p>
    <p>
        (d) Regularly change the PIN to access your Account and the SUYOOL Card PIN.
    </p>
    <p>
        (e) Secure the Device used to access your Account and prevent unauthorized use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        (f) Refrain from utilizing any functionality, whether Device or software specific, that allows for the storage
        or automatic retrieval of Account Credentials
    </p>
    <p>
        (g) Ensure that the Account is securely logged out after each use.
    </p>
    <p>
        (h) Download the latest software for your Device and the latest version of the App as soon as they are
        available.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.3 If at any time, you believe that your Account, SUYOOL Card, Credentials or the Device used to access the App
        have been stolen, lost, or compromised (as applicable), it is imperative that you promptly notify us and report
        the incident to seek immediate assistance. Taking swift action is vital to mitigate potential risks and protect
        your Account and SUYOOL Card against unauthorized use or fraudulent activities. You should also freeze your
        SUYOOL Card using the App and following the prompts or by calling us.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.4 By using our Platform, you understand and agree that we will never request sensitive information, such as
        your passwords or personal identification details, through unsolicited emails, phone calls, or any other means
        of communication. You should exercise caution and refrain from sharing such information in response to any
        suspicious requests. In case of any doubts or concerns about the legitimacy of a communication purportedly from
        us, you should immediately contact us through the official contact channels provided in section 8.1 to verify
        the authenticity of the request or report any potential fraudulent activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.5 We shall not be held liable for any unauthorized access to the Account or any associated damages that may
        result. While we take reasonable measures to ensure the security of our Platform, you acknowledge that no system
        is entirely immune to potential risks or unauthorized intrusions, especially considering that all transactions
        are processed by automated methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.6 We reserve the right to implement security measures, including but not limited to monitoring Account
        activities and transactions, in order to protect your Account and its users from fraudulent or unauthorized
        activities. You hereby consent to such monitoring and acknowledge that we may take appropriate actions,
        including blocking or suspending Account access or closing your Account, if any suspicious or unauthorized
        activities are detected. You will solely assume full responsibility for any fraudulent, unauthorized, or
        otherwise improper use of the Account or your SUYOOL Card. We shall rely on the authenticity and authority of
        all instructions received by us through the Account and may act upon such instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.7 It is recommended that you regularly review your Account activity, statements, and transactions to identify
        any unauthorized or suspicious activities promptly. If any discrepancies or unauthorized transactions are
        noticed, you must notify us immediately to initiate an investigation and take appropriate actions to resolve the
        issue. You hereby agree to cooperate with us to investigate any suspected illegal or fraudulent activity.
    </p>

    <div class="title">6. ACCOUNT ACTIVITY TRACKING AND COMMUNICATION</div>
    <p>
        6.1 The Account Holder can track the activity and transactions associated with their
        Account, review their history, and download Account statements through the Corporate Account Portal on
        SUYOOL’s
        website. The Account Holder will have access to their Account activity information, including
        downloadable
        statements, until the Account is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.2 SUYOOL may send notifications to the Account Holder's Device, or
        email (as applicable) to inform them of any incoming or outgoing payments, transactions, or transfers.
        The
        Account Holder should regularly check their Account activity for comprehensive information on payments,
        transactions, and transfers.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.3 SUYOOL may also communicate with the Account Holder via text message. It is the
        responsibility of the Account Holder to keep SUYOOL updated and promptly inform SUYOOL of any changes in
        the
        information provided. If SUYOOL discovers that any provided information is incorrect, SUYOOL reserves
        the right
        to unilaterally update the information after obtaining the prior written approval of the Account Holder.
    </p>

    <div class="title">6. YOUR UNDERTAKINGS</div>

        fraudulent conduct. In the event that we refuse to execute a transaction, order, or other utilization of our
        Services, we will promptly notify you and provide you with valid and substantiated reasons for the refusal,
